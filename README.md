# README

This repository provides the script to reproduce the work from Lewi et al. 2022


# Notes:

- Since we are using an older version of pomp, you will need to install `pomp.orig` package first.
- Running `auto.R` takes several hours to complete.
- Run the file `result.R` will collect and process the results.
- `Best_ncov.csv` always contains the current best MLL and MLE.
- Run the file `fig3.R` to reproduce the paper`s main results.
